    <h2>Kaumudi</h2>
    <p>
        still remember the moment we met
        The rude you I still can't forget.
        Who knew that moment a story began,
        We and destiny had different very plan.
        I thought I'd never see you again,
        When you walked away waving your hand.
        But I met you again after 8 months in November
        I don't know why so well I remember. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem me">
    <h2>Jeet</h2>
    <p>
        You say I was rude, maybe it’s true,
        But back then, all I saw was the topper in you.
        I was the backbencher, lost in my way,
        Hardly noticed you, until that day.
        In November, our story found its start,
        I got to know you, piece by part.
        But you didnt like me, I could see,
        Still, something about you captivated me.
        December 8th, its so clear to me,
        Thats the day you became my destiny.
        My eyes met yours, I fell so hard,
        Every moment since, you held my heart.
        I didnt get up, I didnt even try,
        Falling for you felt better than the sky.
        You didnt see me, not the way I saw you,
        But my heart was yours before I even knew.
        It wasn’t just likin, it was something more,
        A love so deep I couldnt ignore.  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="poem her">
    <h2>Kaumudi</h2>
    <p>
        Then I approved you out of blue,
        Your t shirt to which my eyes were glue.
        The offer was good, 
        you could have Joined my girls group.
        Then I saw you dance, 
        In the competition by chance.
        You looked Charmingly cute.
        But I decided to stay mute.
        Cause that time, someone else had my attention.
        Better that his name I don't mention.
        Then we texted, and as unknown souls
        With completely different goals.
        The trip came next, 
        You spoke outside the text.
        Your eyes were on me, long stares.
        But I brushed it off, saying who cares.
        Then one day, I had a heart break.
        I told you for supports sake.
        I was thinking to do something stupid,
        Was going to get set up with 
        someone random by my own cupid.
        But you said, no wrong decision.
        Don't know why I cared to listen. 
    </p>

  <div class="poem me">
    <h2>Jeet</h2>
    <p>
        I didn’t just fall in love... you were everything to me,
        I craved your attention like the air I breathe.
        Every day, I wanted to text, to talk,
        To hear your voice, to share every walk.
        You didn’t know, but you were my sun,
        Lighting up my world before the day begun.
        I’d wait for a “hi,” I’d wait for a sign,
        But you were his... and you were never mine.
        I won’t lie, I was jealous, it tore me apart,
        Seeing you with him broke my heart.
        Still, I smiled, stayed in the friend zone,
        Hiding the love I called my own.
        Then came the day your world turned gray,
        You told me he left, he walked away.
        A part of me smiled... a selfish spark,
        Thinking maybe now I had a shot in the dark.
        But that smile died the moment I saw,
        Tears in your eyes, trembling in awe.
        You were broken, shattered, lost in pain,
        And suddenly, my love didn’t feel the same.
        Because I saw it then... clear as the sky,
        You needed comfort, not another guy.
        So I stayed, I listened, I held your hand,
        I became your peace, your place to stand.
        I heard the story of how he let you down,
        While hiding my tears, masking my frown.
