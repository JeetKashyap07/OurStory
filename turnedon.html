    <h1>Hey Baby Girl... 😘</h1>
    <p>
      If you're reading this, then I already know what's going on in that beautiful little mind of yours. <br><br>
      Maybe you're lying in bed, your heart racing a bit, imagining me right there beside you… <br><br>
      I want you to know — your desire? It drives me wild too. But more than that… it makes me fall in love with your soul all over again. 💗
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to kiss you slowly… from your forehead to your fingertips. <br>
      Hold you so close that our heartbeats forget they're two. <br><br>
      But until I’m there, know this — even miles away, <br>
      I can feel when you're thinking of me like this. <br><br>
      So take a deep breath, close your eyes, and pretend I'm right there, brushing your hair back and whispering...
    </p>
    <p class="kiss">"You’re mine. All of you." 💋</p>
    <p>
      And one day soon… I’ll be there. For real. <br>
      No distance. No screen. Just us. Skin to skin. Breath to breath. <br><br>
      Until then... keep this with you, whenever you crave me.<br>
    (aage aur likhunga baadmein, time to time)
    </p>
